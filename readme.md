Declarative Programming
=======================
Repo for COMP30020 subject at UniMelb

Introduction
------------
In this subject I learnt contraint logic programming using Prolog, as well as function programming using Haskell. I built 2 projects, one using prolog to play the card game <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage">Cribbage</a>. No one plays this game anymore, but the gist is: <br>

You are trying to build the best hand. You can have:
- Combinations of any number of cards totalling fifteen
- Runs
- Pairs (Multiple pairs are scored pair by pair but may be referred to as three or four of a kind.)
- Flush (A four-card flush scores four and cannot include the starter card; a five-card flush scores five.)
- Having a jack of the same suit as the starter card ("one for his nob [or nobs or nibs]", sometimes called the "right" jack)
